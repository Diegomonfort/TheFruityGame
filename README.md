## Backend Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the backend. **Note:** It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

### 1. Install Python  
If Python is not installed on your system, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### 2. Verify the Installation  
Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands to ensure Python and pip are correctly installed:  
```bash
py --version
py -m pip --version
